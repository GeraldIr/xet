For contributing, make sure to follow these guidelines:

# Bugfixes:
  - Make sure to include a unit test which covers the scenario you are trying to fix (Test Fails before fix inclusion, passes after fix is applied).

# Features:
  - Create an issue first, there are some features that wouldn't be merged in any case.
  - Try and keep the style of the original program for legibility.
  - Include Unit Tests covering the new feature.
